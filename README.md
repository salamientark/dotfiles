# Personnal configuration
This is my personnal configuration.
I'm actually using Ubuntu with :
- I3wm as window manager
- Zsh + powerlevel10k as terminal and theme
- neovim as code editor

## Install
Just run :
    ```git clone git@github.com:salamientark/Full-config.git && cd Full-config && sudo -u $(whoami) ./install.sh```
